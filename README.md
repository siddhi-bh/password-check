# 🔐 Password Strength Tester (Python CLI + GUI)

Hi! This is a Python-based password strength tester that helps users understand how secure their password is.

It includes:
- ✅ A terminal version (CLI)
- ✅ A simple GUI using Tkinter.
- ✅ Optional check for common dictionary words.

This was built as part of my cybersecurity learning to explore user input validation, password policies, and user-friendly interfaces.

## 🧠 What I Learned:

- How to check for password complexity (length, symbols, numbers)
- Regex patterns for detecting secure components.
- GUI design with `tkinter`
- Why dictionary passwords like "123456" are dangerous.

## 🚀 How to Use

### ▶️ CLI Version:
```bash
python password_checker.py

### ▶️ GUI Version:
```bash
python password_tester.py
